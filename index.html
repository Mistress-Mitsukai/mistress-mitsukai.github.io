        <h1>Top 5 Things that I Love to Do!</h1>
                <p>Life is definitely one of the greatest pkaygrounds that a human can be presented with. Sometimes, it is what the human chooses to
                   do on this playground that defines them and their personalities. I feel like many of the things that I enjoy doing have something
                   to do with different aspects of my personalities, since can be reserved, yet spontaneous at the same time.</p>

        <h2>1. Watching Videos</h2>
                <p>Ever since childhood, I began to pick up on other things and sayings from watching videos on YouTube, TV shows, and anime shows on
                   CrunchyRoll and KissAnime. Not only to I find myself learning different lessons and strategies from watching such videos, but they
                   provided a great source of entertainment. Also, I could watch television while being grounded from playing video games (becuase
                   according to my logic back then, you couldn't play a TV).</p>

        <h2>2. Drawing</h2>
                <p>It took me a while to realize that I loved to draw, but it was a way I could freely express myself without having to worry about
                   tripping over my words while atempting to communicate verbally with somebody. Eventually, after looking at simple, yet wonderfully
                   expressed drawings that other poeple began to post on Wattpad, I decided that I wanted to share my drawings with everybody and slowly
                   improve my own drawing style by drawing fanart and comics for other people.</p>

        <h2>3. Writing Stories</h2>
                <p>Something I've always wanted to do since I was a child was to write a novel and becomme a famous, well-respected author. Even though
                   I'll admit that my writing was beyond terrible in elementary school, I improved by taking many extracurricular forces to the point
                   where I could easily write characters and do analyses on other people's characters. I have tried writing many stories, but I have
                   never been able to finsih one, due to me having a tendency to lose motivation easily.</p>

        <h2>4. Daydreaming</h2>
                <p>I'm not a really big fan of reality and the real world, so I tend to tune out whenever I feel upset or saddened in some way. Whenever
                   I sleep or feel this way, I </p>
